# Contributing to ORI

Thanks for your interest in ORI. Our goal is to provide open source Onchain Risk Intelligence tools to the community.

## Getting Started

ORI's [open issues are here](https://github.com/syntifi/ori/issues). An easy way to get started helping the project is to *file an issue*. You can do that on the ORI issues page by clicking on the green button at the right. Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated. 

If you have any ideas you would like to discuss, please kick of a new discussion at [ideas](https://github.com/syntifi/ori/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Contributions

ORI welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to ORI should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will
be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the
main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests). 

- Don't put submodule updates in your pull request unless they are to landed
  commits.

- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review
  it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a
  comment.

- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
